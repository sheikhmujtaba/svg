        <p>
            cale is a function stored in the d3 library.  Scale takes a dataset and domain, then it returns an output and a range. Then you can put values inside your scale function and scale will give you the value within the output range. Moreover, we can use d3.max and d3.min to get the maximum and minimum values for our dataset without looking into the data. We can integrate d3.max and min inside our scale to define our domain.

            Two ways scale helps with visualization is that you can scale scatterplots and improve them by incorporating scaled values inside the scatter plot. In addition, you can create time scale plot as well by using scale function by converting the strings into dates first so that they can be recognized by the scale function as numbers. Moreover, there are other built in functions inside d3 for scale such as scaleSqrt which gives the square root scale. Other similar functions are ScalePow , Scalelog and scalequantize
